## wingrapher

A simple application written in WinForms that allows to create graph nodes with multiple inputs & outputs.
You can add/remove nodes, create new nodes, connect nodes and basically everything you'd want to do.

This was a made as a nice little fun project to explore the capabilities of the WinForms framework.

### Controls

When you open the application, you may press `G` while focused on the orange area to prepare to place a new node.
Clicking the orange area after pressing `G` will place a node with a random name and random amount of inputs / outputs onto the screen.

You can press `F` to open a window for searching/creating custom nodes. It's controls are somewhat funky, as it was made for prototyping rather than anything else.
